I am a senior undergraduate student in Computer Science and Technology at [NEFU](https://www.nefu.edu.cn/), graduating in 2024.

I investigate self-refinement mechanisms for **large language models**, developing lightweight frameworks that enhance reasoning consistency through automated error detection and human-aligned correction.
